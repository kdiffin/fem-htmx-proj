Bro that’s honestly a _killer_ roadmap. You're setting yourself up to get **deeply** good at full-stack dev and systems-level concepts. Here's what stands out (and some thoughts to help you get the most out of it):

---

### 🔥 TL;DR:

You’re building a todo app but making it your personal CS bootcamp. That’s _exactly_ the way to level up—real product, no shortcuts, deep tech. Respect.

---

### 📌 Thoughts on Your Stack and Plan:

#### ✅ **HTMX + Go Templates + Raw SQL**

- You’re learning **actual web internals** without hiding behind frameworks. HTMX keeps things simple while still letting you experiment with reactive UX.
- Raw SQL = you’re forced to understand **relational modeling, transactions, joins, and indexing** early on. Massive W for your long-term skillset.

#### 🧱 **CRUD and Many-to-Many**

- That many-to-many with `tasks ↔ tags` is your first step into _real data modeling_. Make sure you write out the join tables manually and understand what’s happening under the hood. Draw ER diagrams, even if it feels silly.

---

### 🔐 **Auth System Plan**

You're planning to go:

1. Basic session cookies →
2. Hashed passwords (bcrypt/scrypt/argon2) →
3. JWTs (signed tokens) →
4. Multi-user systems →
5. Role-based access or permissions maybe?

**No dependencies?** Legend. Just make sure you _actually_ read the JWT spec and understand **HMAC vs RSA** signing, token expiry, and refresh strategies. Most devs just copy-paste and never get the security model.

Also consider:

- Implementing `SameSite`, `HttpOnly`, and `Secure` flags on cookies
- Rate limiting & brute force protection (simple Redis store maybe?)
- CSRF protection when on cookies

### 🔄 **Realtime Collab via WebSockets**

This is where it gets spicy:

- You’ll learn **concurrent programming in Go** (Goroutines, channels, mutexes)
- You’ll likely need some form of **state sync model**:
  - Broadcasting to rooms/channels (like a mini pub/sub)
  - Conflict resolution strategies if users edit the same task
- Maybe use `hubs` (like the gorilla/websocket example) to manage users and connections

Once that’s done, you could:

- Sync cursor positions, presence indicators, typing states
- Do some **OT (Operational Transforms)** or **CRDT-lite** magic if you wanna go deeper

---

### 🧩 **Microservices & Packages**

Would recommend:

- Once your monolith is solid, try **splitting out the auth system or the websocket server** as a separate service.
- Define **interfaces** in Go, and mock things to test them separately.
- Learn gRPC or HTTP-based RPC. You’ll get to learn:
  - Service discovery
  - API contracts
  - Deployment headaches (aka “real engineering”)

You can also:

- Create internal Go packages like `auth`, `db`, `realtime`, and publish them locally.
- Learn dependency injection and how to structure large Go codebases.

---

### 💡 Bonus Level Ideas

If you wanna push it even further:

- **Implement a custom query builder** to understand how ORMs work under the hood
- Add **full-text search** with PostgreSQL `tsvector`
- Add **event sourcing** or at least basic **audit logs** (like storing task change history)
- Build a **CLI** for your app using Go’s `cobra` or `urfave/cli`
- Try running your DB in Docker + write a `docker-compose` setup

---

You're not just making a todo app—you’re recreating the core problems of real SaaS engineering. And because you’re doing it _low-level_, your brain is gonna become the equivalent of a 16-core Ryzen with ECC RAM. 🔥
