Let’s split it clean:  
**Non-Docker path** (more raw control, better for learning how Linux services + filesystems work)  
vs.  
**Docker path** (clean, repeatable deploys, faster once you get comfy)

You’ll learn both — and that’s a **10x dev unlock**. So here’s the updated roadmap:

---

# 🧠 Full Self-Hosting Roadmap (Go App)

> With both **non-Docker** & **Dockerized** paths — pick your poison (or learn both 🧪)

---

## ✅ 1. 🧱 Server Prep (Same for Both Paths)

- 🔧 Install Linux (Mint XFCE, Debian, Ubuntu Server — minimal)
- 🛠️ Setup basics:
  - `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
  - `sudo ufw allow ssh`
  - `hostnamectl set-hostname my-server`
- 🔐 SSH access:
  - Use public key auth
  - Disable password login later for security
- 🌐 Static IP or install **Tailscale** for easy remote access

---

## 🛠️ 2. Deploy Your App (Two Options Below)

---

### 🧼 Option A: **Raw Non-Docker Install** (Bare Metal)

#### 🔧 Build Your App

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app-name .
```

#### 📁 Move It to the Server

```bash
scp app-name user@server:/home/user/
```

#### 📄 Create a `systemd` service

`sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/app.service`

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Go App
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/user/app-name
WorkingDirectory=/home/user
Restart=always
EnvironmentFile=/home/user/.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl enable app
sudo systemctl start app
```

🔄 App now autostarts on boot like a native daemon!

---

### 🐳 Option B: **Dockerized Deploy**

#### 📝 Your `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.21 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o main .

FROM debian:bullseye-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/main .
COPY .env .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./main"]
```

#### 🧃 Your `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    env_file:
      - .env
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:16
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
      POSTGRES_DB: swagdb
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

#### 🚀 Deploy it!

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

🎉 Now both your Go app and Postgres are running isolated and restart-safe.

---

## 🌐 3. Reverse Proxy & HTTPS (Same for Both)

- Use **Caddy** or **Nginx** to:
  - Route port 80/443 to your app
  - Handle TLS with Let’s Encrypt

Caddy example (super easy):

```bash
sudo apt install caddy
```

`/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```
mydomain.com {
  reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Reload:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

---

## 🔄 4. Maintenance Stuff (Applies to Both)

| Task               | Non-Docker Command      | Docker Command               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Restart app        | `systemctl restart app` | `docker compose restart app` |
| View logs          | `journalctl -u app -f`  | `docker logs -f app`         |
| Update app         | SCP + recompile         | `docker compose up --build`  |
| Update Postgres    | Manual backup + upgrade | Change image + restart       |
| Auto-start on boot | systemd does it         | `restart: always` in Compose |

---

## 🔥 Which One Should You Use?

| You want to...                               | Use...     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Learn raw Linux skills (systemd, services)   | Non-Docker |
| Deploy/update fast with configs in code      | Docker     |
| Keep it minimal, one app only                | Non-Docker |
| Use multiple services (Postgres, Redis, etc) | Docker     |
| Ship the same config to multiple servers     | Docker     |
| Avoid messing up your host system            | Docker     |

> 💡 Real talk?  
> Start **non-Docker first** to feel the OS, then switch to **Docker** when you wanna scale, simplify deploys, or work with more services.

Want me to make you a `.deb` installer later? Or a visual of both paths side-by-side?

Which one you wanna go with first: **raw Linux app**, or **Docker stack**?
