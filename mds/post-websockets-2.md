🔥 **TL;DR**:
After vaults + collab via WebSockets, you’ll have built a serious real-time, permission-aware, multi-user backend — that’s _already_ high-tier. Next, the most impactful steps in your backend/fullstack/dev journey are:

1. **Caching, scaling, and pub/sub (Redis, NATS)**
2. **Background jobs and task queues**
3. **Search indexing (Bleve, Meilisearch, or PG full-text)**
4. **Auth hardening (OAuth2, magic links, rate limits)**
5. **Deployment, CI/CD, and ops (Docker, systemd, fly.io, etc.)**
6. **Domain modeling (DDD-lite, CQRS, and business logic separation)**
7. **Testing culture, fixtures, mocks, and observability**

### 🧠 Here’s a step-by-step _verbose_ roadmap tailored for your current project & dev phase:

---

## ✅ **1. Real-Time Scaling: Redis or NATS**

Now that you’re doing WebSockets, you’ll quickly hit the **“how do I broadcast this to _all_ users editing the same vault?”** problem.

That’s where **pub-sub** comes in.

### ✨ Learn:

- Use **Redis pub-sub** or **NATS** to send updates across Go processes (or servers).
- Handle collaborative editing messages like:

  ```json
  {
    "vault_id": "abc",
    "action": "edit_task",
    "data": { ... }
  }
  ```

- WebSocket hub in Go subscribes to that and pushes changes to connected clients.

💡 Start with Redis, it’s easy to set up and good enough until you scale crazy.

---

## ⚙️ **2. Background Workers & Job Queues**

You’ll soon want to run **async tasks** like:

- Sending emails (invites, password resets)
- Vault activity logs
- Deferred cleanup (e.g., deleting a task 30 days after archived)

### ✨ Learn:

- Use **Go channels + goroutines** for baby jobs
- Graduate to **Redis-backed job queues** (e.g. [Asynq](https://github.com/hibiken/asynq))
- Retry logic, deduplication, dead-letter queues — all real-world stuff

This makes your backend “elastic” and much more robust.

---

## 🔍 **3. Search: Full-text Indexing**

When you’ve got dozens of vaults, each with hundreds of tasks and tags, **search** becomes key UX.

### ✨ Learn:

- PostgreSQL `tsvector` search (built-in full-text search)
- Or plug in a separate indexer like:

  - [Bleve](https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve) (Go-native)
  - [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) (insanely fast and easy)

Let users type `"todo meeting tag:urgent"` and get lightning-fast results.

Bonus: Teaches you about **denormalization**, indexing strategies, and ranking results.

---

## 🔐 **4. Advanced Auth (OAuth2, RBAC, rate limits)**

Once collab is in, your next auth layer isn’t just “is this user logged in?” It’s:

- What _role_ does this user have in this vault?
- How do I let users invite others securely?
- Should I support Google/GitHub login?

### ✨ Learn:

- **RBAC**: Role-based access control
- **OAuth2**: Let users sign in with Google/GitHub
- **Magic links** or passwordless login
- **Rate-limiting login attempts** (middleware or Redis)
- **Secure token rotation and refresh** (if you try JWT later)

---

## 🚀 **5. Real Deployment, System Design, and Infra**

If you’re still `go run main.go`-ing everything, it’s time to learn:

- Docker (containerize your app)
- `systemd` or `supervisord` to keep it running on reboot
- `fly.io` or `Railway` for PaaS-style deploys
- GitHub Actions for CI
- `.env` handling, secrets management, config files

You’ll start to feel like a _real devops beast_ 🐉

---

## 🧠 **6. Domain Modeling & Business Logic**

As your app’s logic gets richer (vault collab rules, editing history, roles), you’ll want to organize your code around **behavior**, not just "CRUD."

### ✨ Learn:

- Use `internal/vault/usecase.go` or `vault/service.go` to isolate business logic
- Separate “what happens” (domain logic) from “how it’s stored” (repo layer)
- Light DDD (Domain Driven Design) vibes:

  - Vault is an entity
  - User is an aggregate
  - Commands/events instead of just POST/GET

This will make your codebase age gracefully as features stack up.

---

## 🧪 **7. Tests, Fixtures, Mocks, Coverage**

Now is the time to level up testing into a daily weapon:

- Unit tests for your services (`vaultService.CreateVault`)
- Integration tests for auth, WebSocket flows
- Use `httptest.NewServer()` to test real API flows
- Create _fixtures_ (pre-loaded test data) and _mocks_ (fake services)
- Test coverage tools like `go test -cover`

You’ll thank yourself later when you refactor vault collaboration logic and don’t break 10 things accidentally.

---

## 🧰 Bonus: What You Could Add for Fun

- 📎 **File uploads to vaults** (S3-compatible)
- 🔔 **HTMX + SSE notifications** for vault changes
- 🧠 **AI Assistant** that analyzes your task habits (use OpenAI or llama.cpp self-hosted)
- 🔀 **Undo/redo** or **edit history** (event sourcing-lite)
