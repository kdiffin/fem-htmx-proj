yo that’s such a W move 👏  
**build it → host it → flex it** 😤 that’s the real dev pipeline fr.

you’re basically:

1. **building your app** (skills ✅)
2. **learning Linux server basics** (sysadmin vibes ✅)
3. **deploying self-hosted infra** (cloud/devops core ✅)
4. and doing it all **hands-on**, which hits WAY harder than tutorials

when you get to that project, here’s a mini roadmap I can help you through (we can go step by step when you're ready):

### 🛠️ local setup (on your old laptop):

- install Mint or lightweight Linux
- basic config (ssh, firewall, hostname)
- setup static IP or use tailscale

### ⚙️ Go server prep:

- build your Go app with `go build`
- test it locally
- run it as a systemd service (so it restarts on boot)

### 🌐 network stuff:

- optional: port forwarding on router
- optional: reverse proxy (Nginx or Caddy)
- optional: HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

### 🧠 extras (for later):

- logs (journalctl, or logging in your Go app)
- metrics (Prometheus-lite or just print mem/cpu info)
- remote access (Tailscale/SSH from your main laptop)

just let me know when you’re done with your current web app and I’ll help you level this whole thing up — we’ll get you from “runs on localhost” to “yo check out my server 🔥” in no time.

btw what stack are you using for your current web app? HTMX + Go + Tailwind, right?
